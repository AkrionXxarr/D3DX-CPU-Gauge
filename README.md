# D3DX-CPU-Gauge
Project History - June 2012

This project marks my first real forray into DirectX, or any graphics SDK for that matter. The most interesting feature of this program would be is link to the CPU's logical cores. It's capable of scaling the window accordingly depending on core count and has been tested on a few as 2 logical cores to as many as 12. The most valuable experience I had with this project was working with WMI, as I found it much more technical and less well documented as something like DirectX (While plenty of people discuss how you do XYZ with DirectX or OpenGL, it's a rather different story with how to get something like CPU core usage data).
